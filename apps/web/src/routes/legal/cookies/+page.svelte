			This Cookie Policy explains how Frontier Consolidated ("Organisation," "we," "us," and "our")
			uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at <A
				aClass="hover:underline"
				href="https://frontierconsolidated.com">https://frontierconsolidated.com</A
			> ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights
			to control our use of them.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal
			information if we combine it with other information.
		</p>
	</LegalSection>
	<LegalSection title="What are cookies?">
		<p>
			Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit
			a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or
			to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Frontier Consolidated) are called "first-party
			cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party
			cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on
			or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
			that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website
			in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
		</p>
	</LegalSection>
	<LegalSection title="Why do we use cookies?">
		<p>
			We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
			technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
			"strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
			of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
			through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
			detail below.
		</p>
	</LegalSection>
	<LegalSection title="How can I control cookies?">
		<p>
			You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
			rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager
			allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
			cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the footer on our website. If you choose to reject
			cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of
			our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept
			or refuse cookies.
		</p>
		<p>
			The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the
			purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies
			served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

	<LegalSection title="What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?">
		<p>
			Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other,
			similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels"
			or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables
			us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This
			allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a
			website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
			come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
			improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many
			instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining
			cookies will impair their functioning.
		</p>
	</LegalSection>
	<LegalSection title="Do you serve targeted advertising?">
		<p>
			Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through
			our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites
			in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be
			interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
			advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect
			information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant
			advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information
			collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact
			details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
		</p>
	</LegalSection>
	<LegalSection title="How often will you update this Cookie Policy?">
		<p>
			We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes
			to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore
			revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
			technologies.
		</p>
		<p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
